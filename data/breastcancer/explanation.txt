Classification for Case: malignant

A lower Uniformity Of Cell Shape Value supports the classification of:malignant
Because the query cases'Uniformity Of Cell Shape value is lower than the fortiori caseit does support the classification
A lower Bare Nuclei Value supports the classification of:malignant
Because the query cases'Bare Nuclei value is lower than the fortiori caseit does support the classification
A lower Single Epithelial Cell Size Value does not support the classification of: malignant
Because the query cases'Single Epithelial Cell Size value is lower than the fortiori caseit does not support the classification
A lower Clump Thickness Value does not support the classification of: malignant
Because the query cases'Clump Thickness value is lower than the fortiori caseit does not support the classification
A lower Mitoses Value does not support the classification of: malignant
Because the query cases'Mitoses value is lower than the fortiori caseit does not support the classification
A lower Uniformity Of Cell Size Value supports the classification of:malignant
Because the query cases'Uniformity Of Cell Size value is lower than the fortiori caseit does support the classification
A lower Marginal Adhesion Value supports the classification of:malignant
Because the query cases'Marginal Adhesion value is lower than the fortiori caseit does support the classification
A higher Bland Chromatin Value does not support the classfication of: malignant
Because the query cases'Bland Chromatin value is higher than the fortiori caseit does not support the classification
A lower Normal Nucleoli Value does not support the classification of: malignant
Because the query cases'Normal Nucleoli value is lower than the fortiori caseit does not support the classification
